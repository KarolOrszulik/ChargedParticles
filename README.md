#Charged Particles

This is a sketch made to simulate a field of suspended,
mutually repellent electrostatically charged particles.
This also desctibes magnetised bodies.
  
Each particle is repelled from every other particle
with a force given by Coulomb's law of electrostatic attraction/repulsion.
  
Particles are also repelled from the mouse pointer
whenever the left mouse button is pressed.
